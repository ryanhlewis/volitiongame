I wanted to prove to myself how easy it would be to make a clone of a triple A title like Destiny, so I focused on remaking the title screen, selection menu, and Orbit. It looks rough, but if I had more time, I would have easily implemented easier fades, more aesthetic UI, and higher resolution textures. It's functional, at least. :)
