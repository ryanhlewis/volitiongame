Volition is blatant parody of Bungie's Destiny.

I wanted to see how far I could emulate a triple A studio and game title from my desk, and so worked on recreating the Title Screen, Character Selection, and Orbit screens from the iconic Destiny series inside of Unity.



Overall, a resounding success. I am happy about the result- and provided some music, this could pass as an actual game. However, I did not spend too much time defining rough details, and so things like lighting and texture resolution especially within the Orbit menu serve to break the illusion.

For parodying the style and even closely resembling how a major AAA game looks, I think I did rather well. This was also a fun project because it involved a variety of new things to learn: Gaussian blur code, rotating planets, detecting and dismissing menus, as well as animations and Photoshop on the side.

I loved doing this, and it certainly is one of the more fun things I've done with coding and Unity. However, because this is seemingly so much like Destiny, for legal purposes- this is a parody, and not affiliated with Bungie in any way, shape, or form. All assets used were created by me, and the Unity asset creators listed below.

You may find some Destiny screenshots within the Assets folder. I used these for reference, and you can use them for comparison as well.





(The Unity assets I used are all listed below, and all are free on the Unity Asset Store.)

- Customizable Planet Shaders provided by Proxy Games

- Dissolve Edge provided by Moonflower Carnivore

- Stellar Sky provided by Satsuru
